# Install the extension on Firefox for Android

Experimental extension support has been recently enabled in the Firefox for
Android Nightly. Therefore, if you want to run the extension on your Android
device, you can do so by installing
[Firefox Nightly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.fenix)
and following these steps:

- [Expanded extension support in Firefox for Android Nightly](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/)

The instructions state you should create a collection to include the extensions
you want to make available to install. If you don't want to create your own, you
can use the collection I have created just for this extension. My user ID is
`16207307` and the collection name is `twpt`.

*** note
**Note:** In order to access the options page, go to the _Firefox menu_ >
_Add-ons_ > _Add-ons Manager_ > _TW Power Tools_ > _Settings_.
