# Block saving drafts

Feature that blocks saving drafts of your replies as you type to Google servers
in the Community Console.

## Status

The feature logic is not yet in this folder. The migration is pending as part
of [issue 176][bug]. Please take a look at `//src/options/bgHandler.js` for the
actual logic that will be eventually migrated here.
