After installing the extension, adjust it to your needs by clicking its icon in the extensions menu to access the options page. This is because features other than infinite scroll are disabled by default.

You can see a list of all the enhancements here: https://gerrit.avm99963.com/plugins/gitiles/infinitegforums/+/HEAD/docs/features.md

New additions in future updates will be disabled by default, and can be manually enabled in the options page. Join https://groups.google.com/g/twpowertools-discuss to receive updates about new functionality.

The source code is available here: https://gerrit.avm99963.com/plugins/gitiles/infinitegforums. Contributions are welcome!
